	<h3> Introduction </h3>
	<p>
		The Jersey Planning Application process began by recieveing an email from the archetects.
		It was assencial they give us the tile the exact geolocated tile number and seeing if the surrounding 50m.
		This allowed me to located the location of the boundary the model had modelled for.
	</p>
	<img src="images/realsim/contextareaJPG.JPG" width="60%" height="60%">
	<p>
		I then had to put the archetects name, email and company into the excel spread sheet as well as the application number and the status of the projects as and dates.
		I then marked out the 50 meter boundary of the area we were modeling using photoshop.
		This allowed me to identify if there were any surrounding buildings to have modelled in the periphery or the main model.
		If there were missing buildings we would import them based on the tile number and the geolocated models we already had.
		If we had none but the buildings were still missing, we would request an external model to create these and send a quote to jersey planning.
	</p>

	<p>
		I would then Import the applicant’s models into SketchUp, Orinise the model and ensuring all faces were flipped the correct way.
		A plug in was then used to convert the geolocated unitys from sketch up into unity.
		I would then fix all the materials, import the before and after model into the templace scene as well as the geolocated buildings and terrain.
		I would then import the vegitation into the scene based on the site plan, create a before and after of the terrain and models using the gui tools and modeling tools.
		I would then send the PC viewer to the applicant for review and update the spread sheet.
		when the model was approved I would then compile the pc web viewer and send it off to the applicant.

	<p>
		The model had to be put into a database for a checksum to be calculated and a backup would be put on the share point.
		Occasionally an applicant would have to change or update the application or gives us the incurrect ID for the model.
		This ment I had to log on to the database machine remotly and update the table using queries.
