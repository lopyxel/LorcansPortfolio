			<h2> Description: </h2>
			<p> 
				For our third year project we were given the task of creating a vehicle game using the unity physics engine. 
				I decided to create a fasted paced endless runner. The aim of the game is to hit the gates to increase the score multiplier.<br> 
				I had taken the players perception of speed and cleaver use of audio into consideration. 
				This was the first project that got me into 3d modeling. 
				It also peaked the interest of Realsim as they required a dev who had experience with simulating trains.
				<br>Play through with music begins at 4 mins 25 seconds 
			</p>

			<h3>Plan</h3>
			<p>
				I knew we were making a vehicle game and as a result I wasnted to create something uniqeu and different.
				I knew I wanted to make a train game, but considered the limited motion of a train.
				I was with my brother Daniel disgussing and drawing how this game would go.
				We came up with this simple plan.
				The main aspects of the game had to be:
				<br>-endless runner
				<br>-hit gates to boost and get a score multiplier
				<br>-near mis obsticles for more points
				<br>-collect points
				<br>-music had to be a big part of the experience
				<br>
				Since it was a train off the rails until you hit the gate, I named this project Off The Rails.
			</p>
		
			<h3>Modeling & design</h3>
			<p>
				I knew I wanted the game to look sci-fi. 
				I really love sythwave and really wanted to encorperate that style to the game.
				Its like the 1970s interpretation of the future.
				Once I became aquainted with post processing I became obsessed with Bloom. I wanted to make everything glow in this game.
				I modeled up a sudo city to facilitate the player. 
				I was to generate these as the player moves forward.
				I also modeled the train, boost and points.
			<p>
			<h3>Level Generation</h3>
			<p>
				I generated the level by creating prefabs. 
				When the player reaches a certain distance within the end of the level segment, I instanciate more level pieces.
				the tracks work in a simular manner but i instead updater their positions in an itteraive manner. 
			</p>
			<h3>Audio</h3><img style="float: right;" src="images/unity/offTheRails - obsticle.PNG" width="35%" height="35%" alt="">
			<p>
				I had already created a sythwave track that I felt captured the vibe I was going for. 
				I created boost and boost sound effects. 
				It became apparent that the point collection sound effect was very harsh on the ears,
				As a result I created sounds that were notes in the correct key to the music. 
				It was then a matter of itterating to the next sound every time a point was collected and a sound was played.  
				I also wanted to increase the players perception of speed by giveing the generated objects a wind sound. 
				If the player was traveleing within a certain speed range the volume of this windsound would be effected.
			</p>

			<h3>Player Behavior</h3>
			<p>
				To further increase the players perception of speed I increase the players field of view relative to the speed they are traveleing. 
				With the periferal buildings modeled in blender and the lines on the ground, the player appears to fly through the level in an exhilorating manner. 
				This was the first time  i had to deal with serialization within unity, I simply went with the player prefs for this to keep track of the high score.
